----


This Bash script allows you to perform a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack using **ICMP ping requests** with varying packet sizes and intervals. The attack levels range from low to maximum, allowing flexibility to simulate different intensity scenarios.

---

## Description

This script sends ICMP ping requests to a target IP address with different configurations of packet size and ping interval. You control the attack intensity by selecting one of the following levels:

- **Level 1**: Low (4096 bytes, 0.01 seconds interval)
- **Level 2**: Medium (8192 bytes, 0.005 seconds interval)
- **Level 3**: High (16384 bytes, 0.002 seconds interval)
- **Level 4**: Very High (32768 bytes, 0.001 seconds interval)
- **Level 5**: Maximum (65500 bytes, 0.0005 seconds interval)

This script is primarily intended for performing **stress tests** on networks and servers within controlled environments where you have explicit permission.

---

## Requirements

- A **Linux/Unix-based system** with **Bash**.
- **Root (superuser)** privileges for higher levels (Level 4 and 5).

---

## Usage

To run the script, provide the **destination IP address** and the **attack level** using the `-level` flag.

### Syntax:

```bash
./badping.sh <Destination IP> -level <Level (1-5)>
```

<Destination IP> The target IP address of the server or device.
-level: The intensity of the attack (1-5), where 1 is the least aggressive and 5 is the most aggressive.


### Example Commands:

Level 1 (Low intensity):

```bash
./badping.sh 192.168.1.1 -level 1
```

Level 3 (High intensity):

```bash
./badping.sh 192.168.1.1 -level 3
```

Level 5 (Maximum intensity - requires root privileges):

```bash
sudo ./badping.sh 192.168.1.1 -level 5
```

Note: For higher levels, root (superuser) permissions are required due to larger packet sizes and faster ping intervals. Use sudo as necessary.


| **Level** | **Packet Size (`-s`)** | **Ping Interval (`-i`)** | **Description**       |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| **1**     | 4096 bytes             | 0.01 seconds             | **Low**               |
| **2**     | 8192 bytes             | 0.005 seconds            | **Medium**            |
| **3**     | 16384 bytes            | 0.002 seconds            | **High**              |
| **4**     | 32768 bytes            | 0.001 seconds            | **Very High**         |
| **5**     | 65500 bytes            | 0.0005 seconds           | **Maximum intensity** |



Permissions:
For higher attack levels (Level 4 and 5), root (superuser) privileges may be required due to larger packet sizes and shorter ping intervals. Use sudo to execute the script with the necessary permissions.


### Warnings üö®‚ö†Ô∏è

## üîë Authorization
**Important**: Only use this script on systems or networks where you have explicit permission. Unauthorized use for DoS attacks is illegal and can lead to serious legal consequences. ‚öñÔ∏è

## üí• Impact
This script can overwhelm the target system with a high volume of ping requests, leading to:

- Service disruptions
- Network congestion
- System crashes

Always ensure you conduct tests only in **controlled environments** and with **explicit consent**. üíªüö®

## ‚öñÔ∏è Misuse and Legal Consequences
Misusing this tool can result in serious **legal** and **criminal consequences**. It should only be used for **authorized penetration testing** or **security research**. 

- **Never use this script for malicious purposes**. Unauthorized DoS attacks can lead to **network outages**, **data loss**, and more. üö´
- Always **verify** you have **written consent** from the system or network owner before conducting any tests. üìÑ‚úçÔ∏è
- The creators are **not responsible** for any damage, disruption, or legal repercussions from misuse. By using this script, you accept **full responsibility** for its actions.
