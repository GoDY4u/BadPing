# BadPing 🚀💻

This Bash script allows you to perform a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack using **ICMP ping requests** with varying packet sizes and intervals. The attack levels range from low to maximum, allowing flexibility to simulate different intensity scenarios.

### 🚨 **Warning**:
This script should **only be used on networks and systems where you have explicit authorization**. Unauthorized DoS attacks are **illegal** and can cause severe service disruptions, including network outages and data loss.

---

## Description

This script sends ICMP ping requests to a target IP address with different configurations of packet size and ping interval. You control the attack intensity by selecting one of the following levels:

- **Level 1**: Low (4096 bytes, 0.01 seconds interval)
- **Level 2**: Medium (8192 bytes, 0.005 seconds interval)
- **Level 3**: High (16384 bytes, 0.002 seconds interval)
- **Level 4**: Very High (32768 bytes, 0.001 seconds interval)
- **Level 5**: Maximum (65500 bytes, 0.0005 seconds interval)

This script is primarily intended for performing **stress tests** on networks and servers within controlled environments where you have explicit permission.

---

## Requirements

- A **Linux/Unix-based system** with **Bash**.
- **Root (superuser)** privileges for higher levels (Level 4 and 5).

---

## Usage

To run the script, provide the **destination IP address** and the **attack level** using the `-level` flag.

### Syntax:

```bash
./dos_ping_level.sh <Destination IP> -level <Level (1-5)>
```

<Destination IP> The target IP address of the server or device.
-level: The intensity of the attack (1-5), where 1 is the least aggressive and 5 is the most aggressive.


### Example Commands:

Level 1 (Low intensity):

```bash
./badping.sh 192.168.1.1 -level 1
```

Level 3 (High intensity):

```bash
./badping.sh 192.168.1.1 -level 3
```

Level 5 (Maximum intensity - requires root privileges):

```bash
sudo ./badping.sh 192.168.1.1 -level 5
```

Note: For higher levels, root (superuser) permissions are required due to larger packet sizes and faster ping intervals. Use sudo as necessary.


| **Level** | **Packet Size (`-s`)** | **Ping Interval (`-i`)** | **Description**       |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| **1**     | 4096 bytes             | 0.01 seconds             | **Low**               |
| **2**     | 8192 bytes             | 0.005 seconds            | **Medium**            |
| **3**     | 16384 bytes            | 0.002 seconds            | **High**              |
| **4**     | 32768 bytes            | 0.001 seconds            | **Very High**         |
| **5**     | 65500 bytes            | 0.0005 seconds           | **Maximum intensity** |




Permissions:
For higher attack levels (Level 4 and 5), root (superuser) privileges may be required due to larger packet sizes and shorter ping intervals. Use sudo to execute the script with the necessary permissions.



### Warnings ⚠️

🔑 Authorization:
Only use this script on systems or networks where you have explicit permission. Running DoS attacks without authorization is illegal and can result in serious legal consequences. ⚖️

💥 Impact:
This script can quickly overwhelm the target system with ping requests, potentially causing service disruptions, network congestion, or even system crashes. Always conduct tests in controlled environments and with explicit consent. 💻🚨

⚖️ Misuse Consequences:
Misusing this tool can lead to serious legal consequences, including criminal liability. This script should only be used for authorized penetration testing or security research. Always confirm that you have written permission from the system/network owner before performing any tests. ✋🔐


⚡ Important Notes ⚡

Always verify that you have explicit, written consent before performing any network or system tests. 📄✍️
This tool is NOT for malicious use. Misuse may lead to criminal charges. 🚫
Use only in controlled environments and ethical hacking scenarios. 🛡️
