# DoS Ping Attack Script

This Bash script allows you to perform a **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack using **ICMP ping requests** with varying packet sizes and intervals. The attack levels range from low to maximum, allowing flexibility to simulate different intensity scenarios.

### üö® **Warning**:
This script should **only be used on networks and systems where you have explicit authorization**. Unauthorized DoS attacks are **illegal** and can cause severe service disruptions, including network outages and data loss.

---

## Description

This script sends ICMP ping requests to a target IP address with different configurations of packet size and ping interval. You control the attack intensity by selecting one of the following levels:

- **Level 1**: Low (4096 bytes, 0.01 seconds interval)
- **Level 2**: Medium (8192 bytes, 0.005 seconds interval)
- **Level 3**: High (16384 bytes, 0.002 seconds interval)
- **Level 4**: Very High (32768 bytes, 0.001 seconds interval)
- **Level 5**: Maximum (65500 bytes, 0.0005 seconds interval)

This script is primarily intended for performing **stress tests** on networks and servers within controlled environments where you have explicit permission.

---

## Requirements

- A **Linux/Unix-based system** with **Bash**.
- **Root (superuser)** privileges for higher levels (Level 4 and 5).

---

## Usage

To run the script, provide the **destination IP address** and the **attack level** using the `-level` flag.

### Syntax:

```bash
./dos_ping_level.sh <Destination IP> -level <Level (1-5)>


<Destination IP>: The target IP address of the server or device.
-level: The intensity of the attack (1-5), where 1 is the least aggressive and 5 is the most aggressive.


Example Commands:
Level 1 (Low intensity):

bash
Copiar c√≥digo
./dos_ping_level.sh 192.168.1.1 -level 1
Level 3 (High intensity):

bash
Copiar c√≥digo
./dos_ping_level.sh 192.168.1.1 -level 3
Level 5 (Maximum intensity - requires root privileges):

bash
Copiar c√≥digo
sudo ./dos_ping_level.sh 192.168.1.1 -level 5
Note: For higher levels, root (superuser) permissions are required due to larger packet sizes and faster ping intervals. Use sudo as necessary.

Attack Levels
Level	Packet Size (-s)	Ping Interval (-i)	Description
1	4096 bytes	0.01 seconds	Low
2	8192 bytes	0.005 seconds	Medium
3	16384 bytes	0.002 seconds	High
4	32768 bytes	0.001 seconds	Very High
5	65500 bytes	0.0005 seconds	Maximum intensity

Warnings
Authorization: Only use this script on systems and networks you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized usage is illegal and could result in criminal charges.

Impact: This script can quickly overwhelm the target system with ping requests, potentially causing service disruptions, network congestion, or system crashes. Use responsibly and with explicit authorization.

Permissions: Higher attack levels (Level 4 and 5) may require root (superuser) privileges due to the larger packet sizes and reduced ping intervals. Use sudo where necessary.

Misuse Consequences: Misusing this tool can lead to criminal liability. Do not use this script without proper consent. Always ensure you have written permission from the system or network owner before testing.
